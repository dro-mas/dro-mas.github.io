## What I think it is

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities. :thinking:	

I'm not going to lie, the first thing that pops up in my mind when hearing the word "AI", is [CHATGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

Partly because I heard it became the fastest growing internet app in [history](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2023/02/02/chatgpt-is-the-fastest-growing-ap-in-the-history-of-web-application), but mostly because I've been a regular customer since the day it came out. I mean, what student hasn't, right? 

In my own terms, AI is basically a tool, that grows and learns with every input we provide it with. Much like how a human learns

## How I feel towards it

AI is incredibly useful, and nowadays it seems to be everywhere, which is rightfully so.
