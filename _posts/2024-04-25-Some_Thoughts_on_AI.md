## What I think it is

> Artificial intelligence, or **AI**, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities. 

I'm not going to lie, the first thing that pops up in my mind when hearing the word **AI**, is [CHATGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Partly because I heard it became the fastest growing internet app in [history](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2023/02/02/chatgpt-is-the-fastest-growing-ap-in-the-history-of-web-application), but mostly because I've been a regular customer since the day it came out. I mean, what student hasn't, right? :thinking:	

In my own terms, **AI** is basically a tool, that grows and learns with every input we provide it with. Much like how a human learns. Just like a human, it makes mistakes. ~~for now~~

For example, if i give the input
```
2+2
```
It will give
```
2+2=4
```
But if I then give the input
```
2+2=5
```
Then unless the AI has the database / memory to say otherwise, then it'll assume I am correct, just a like teaching a child. Then the next time someone asks the same question, it will respond with
```
2+2=5
```
Which is just an amusing thing I did for fun when I was bored.

## How I feel towards it

**AI** is incredibly useful, and nowadays it seems to be everywhere, which is rightfully so. It has unlimited potential, and at the rate we are going I think people will keep changing their vision of their future every 5 to 10 years or so.
